# myapp

This is an example project.

### How did the `go.mod` get generated?

```shell
go mod init github.com/jolheiser/myapp
```

Of course, you should change your invocation based on your username and project name.

### Do package names and directory names need to match?

Technically no, but it's **much** less confusing if they do.

### How to run it

```shell
go run .
```
or
```shell
go build && ./myapp
```
